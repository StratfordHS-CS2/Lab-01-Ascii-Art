# Lab 01 - Ascii Art

## Lab Goal
This lab was designed to teach you how to use **print** and **println** to write text to the console window.

## Instructions
In your **Art** class, modify the following methods.
* asciiBox() - Create a box using ascii characters.  Your box should be 25 '+' characters wide and 10 tall.
* asciiBox2() - Create a hollow box 25 characters wide and 10 tall with a message inside.
* asciiArt() - Draw a creature using ascii art.

After committing and pushing to GitHub, edit the first line of **Readme.md** and replace the two instances of "username" with your GitHub username.

## Sample Output
**asciiBox()**

## Notes
* Checkstyle config link is http://www.daveavis.com/cs/checkstyle_SHS.xml
* After cloning your repo from GitHub you can open your code in BlueJ by double clicking on the **package** file.

## Grading
* 30 - asciiBox()
* 30 - asciiBox2()
* 30 - asciiArt()
* 10 - style

Note that these are potential maximums; the computer can only check so much.  If your code passes checkstyle, but I see non-descriptive variable names, then your style grade will go down.  If your code passes all tests, but I see code that was copied off of the internet or from another student your grade will go *way* down.
